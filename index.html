                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p> 
                    Currently, I am a full time second year student at Brooklyn College (Go Bulldogs!) and I am majoring
                    in computer science. I primarily work with Java, as it is the primary language used at my school, and have an
                    intermediate understanding of the language.
                    <br>
                    Outside of CS, I enjoy studying classic literature (Greco-Roman) as well as Philosophy.

                <p>
                    I am an aspiring software engineer. While this is more of a generic term, I wouldn't
                    say I have enough experience in the field to have a set career path in mind. Part of my
                    short-term goals involves completing side projects that would help me figure out a specific
                    path to take. This includes exploring different areas of software engineering, as well as familiarizing
                    myself with new languanges.
