            <p>Here are some projects I have worked on in the past. All of them are course work, but I plan
                on working of a side project or two soon.

                <dd>- This project reads a given Spotify weekly chart for the artists included
                    on the given week. It also calculates the number of occurences for each artist and 
                    produces an output file containing each artist and their number of occurences;

                <dt><a href = "https://github.com/bertom1/CISC3130-lab4">Spotify Financial Quarter PlayList</a></dt>
                <dd>- This project reads all the Spotify weekly charts for 2020 FQ3 and produces
                    a playlist based on the chart songs from the Financial Quarter. No GUI is used, instead
                    the playlist is written as an output file containing the current song playing, as well as the 
                    previously played song.

                <dt><a href = "https://github.com/bertom1/CISC3130_Lab6">Class Grade Calculator</a></dt>
                <dd>- This project creates a grade calculator for my Data Structures class. The user enters input 
                    through the command line for each available student and a grade report containing every student is 
                    written.

                <dt><a href = "https://github.com/bertom1/CISC3130_Lab7">Portfolio website</a></dt>
                <dd>- This site is one of my first experiences using HTML and CSS and was a very good learning experience. I 
                    was mainly learning as I put the site together and is no where near the final product. I plan on using it 
                    as a template for a more thoughout and better designed site.
