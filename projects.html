            <p>Here are some projects I have worked on in the past. All of them are course work, but I plan
                on working of a side project or two soon.

                <dd>- This project reads a given Spotify weekly chart for the artists included
                    on the given week. It also calculates the number of occurences for each artist and 
                    produces an output file containing each artist and their number of occurences;

                <dt><a href = "https://github.com/bertom1/CISC3130-lab4">Spotify Financial Quarter PlayList</a></dt>
                <dd>- This project reads all the Spotify weekly charts for 2020 FQ3 and produces
                    a playlist based on the chart songs from the Financial Quarter. No GUI is used, instead
                    the playlist is written as an output file containing the current song playing, as well as the 
                    previously played song.
