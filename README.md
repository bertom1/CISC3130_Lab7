# CISC3130_Lab7
Coding portfolio website written in HTML and CSS
## Implementation
This project is one of my first attempts at using HTML and CSS to create a website. I had no prior experience using HTML or CSS, so I was using the [W3 HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) as well as the [CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) as a guide. The site I made doesn't have mobile support and is a static site as well. The design is very simple since I wanted to focus on understanding the basics to HTML and CSS as opposed to creating the best site I could. Realistically, I view this as a template for a better portfolio website as opposed to one that I would use now, so I plan on reworking it by improving the UI and adding more content such as images or transitions/animations. The index.html file contains the main page with some background information about me and the projects.html file contains some information about projects
I have completed.

the setup process will differ.  
1. Clone to your machine using `git clone git@github.com:bertom1/CISC3130_Lab7.git` 
2. Open the project directory with the command `cd CISC3130_Lab7`.
3. Commands to run the HTML files vary by OS, here are some ways of opening the HTML file in a browser:  
Windows PowerShell- run command `Invoke-Expression index.html` ([Source](http://www.theovernightadmin.com/2013/11/open-html-file-with-powershell.html))
